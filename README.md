LSD is a liquid staking and leverage staking based yield generating vault. You can deposit your matic and receive LSD tokens which will appreciate in value w.r.t. matic over time ðŸ“ˆ LSD internally uses [Stader](https://www.staderlabs.com/), [Aave](https://aave.com/) & [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/) as well as the whole project.
